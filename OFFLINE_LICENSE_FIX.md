# Offline License Fix

## Problem Fixed

**Issue**: The software license was successfully activated when online, but once the software went offline, it no longer recognized the active license, making the application unusable during offline periods.

**Root Cause**: The license validation system was configured to always require online server validation (`ALLOW_OFFLINE_MODE: false`) and had insufficient offline grace period handling.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enabled Offline Mode

**File**: `src/config/license.ts`

- Changed `ALLOW_OFFLINE_MODE` from `false` to `true`
- Extended `OFFLINE_GRACE_PERIOD` from 24 hours to 30 days for better offline support

```typescript
ALLOW_OFFLINE_MODE: true, // Enable offline mode to allow operation when license server is down
OFFLINE_GRACE_PERIOD: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 30 days in milliseconds (extended for better offline support)
```

### 2. Enhanced Offline Validation Logic

**File**: `src/services/LicenseService.ts`

#### Improved Server Validation with Offline Fallback

- Enhanced `checkLicenseWithServer()` method to provide better offline fallback
- Added comprehensive offline validation criteria:
  1. License must not be expired based on its expiry date
  2. Must be within offline grace period since activation OR last successful check
  3. Cached license data must be valid

#### Better Error Handling for Network Issues

- Modified `isLicensed()` method to distinguish between server validation failures and network errors
- Added intelligent offline operation when network is unavailable
- Preserved valid cached licenses during offline periods

#### Enhanced Activation Process

- Updated `activateLicense()` method to store `lastChecked` timestamp
- Ensures proper offline operation tracking from activation

### 3. Added Offline Status Monitoring

#### New Status Methods

- Added `isInOfflineMode()` method to check offline status
- Enhanced `getLicenseStatus()` with offline information:
  - `isOfflineMode`: Boolean indicating offline operation
  - `offlineInfo`: Detailed timing information for grace period tracking

#### Offline Information Includes

- Time since license activation
- Time since last successful server check
- Grace period remaining
- Offline mode detection

### 4. Updated User Interface

**File**: `src/components/LicenseStatusNotification.tsx`

- Added offline mode notification with WifiOff icon
- Shows remaining offline operation time
- Provides clear guidance to users about offline status
- Enhanced notification logic to include offline mode detection

## How It Works

### Online Operation

1. **Normal Validation**: License validates against server every 10 minutes
2. **Successful Check**: Updates `lastChecked` timestamp and caches result
3. **Status Updates**: Real-time server validation with 5-minute cache

### Offline Operation

1. **Network Detection**: Automatically detects when server is unreachable
2. **Fallback Validation**: Uses cached license data with offline criteria:
   - License expiry date must be in the future
   - Must be within 30-day grace period from activation OR last check
3. **Offline Mode**: Continues normal operation with offline indicator
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Resumes online validation when connection restored

### Grace Period Logic

```typescript
// Allow offline operation if:
// 1. License has not expired
// 2. We're within the offline grace period since activation
// 3. OR the last successful check was recent enough
if (isNotExpired && 
    (timeSinceActivation < OFFLINE_GRACE_PERIOD || 
     timeSinceLastCheck < OFFLINE_GRACE_PERIOD)) {
  // Continue operating offline
}
```

## Benefits

### For Users

- ✅ **Uninterrupted Operation**: Software continues working during network outages
- ✅ **30-Day Grace Period**: Extended offline operation period
- ✅ **Clear Status**: Visual indicators when operating offline
- ✅ **Automatic Recovery**: Seamless transition back to online mode

### For Administrators

- ✅ **Network Resilience**: Software handles temporary network issues gracefully
- ✅ **Remote Locations**: Works in areas with unreliable internet
- ✅ **Business Continuity**: POS operations continue during connectivity issues
- ✅ **Transparent Monitoring**: Clear offline status tracking

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

No additional environment variables required. The fix uses existing configuration:

```env
REACT_APP_LICENSE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000  # Your license server URL
```

### Timing Configuration

Current settings in `src/config/license.ts`:

- **Cache Duration**: 5 minutes (how long to cache validation results)
- **Check Interval**: 10 minutes (how often to validate during operation)
- **Offline Grace Period**: 30 days (how long to allow offline operation)
- **Request Timeout**: 10 seconds (server request timeout)

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing

1. **Activate License Online**:
   - Start the application with internet connection
   - Activate a valid license key
   - Verify normal operation

2. **Test Offline Mode**:
   - Disconnect internet or stop license server
   - Application should continue working
   - Check for offline mode notification

3. **Verify Recovery**:
   - Reconnect internet or restart license server
   - Application should automatically resume online validation
   - Offline notification should disappear

### Expected Behavior

- **With Internet**: Normal online validation every 10 minutes
- **Without Internet**: Offline mode with grace period countdown
- **Grace Period**: 30 days from last successful validation
- **Expired License**: Properly rejected even in offline mode
- **Status Notifications**: Clear offline mode indicators

## Security Considerations

### Offline Security

- License expiry dates are still enforced offline
- Hardware fingerprinting remains active
- Cached licenses are cryptographically validated
- Grace period limits prevent indefinite offline operation

### Network Security

- No changes to encryption or signature validation
- Server communication remains secure
- Offline mode doesn't bypass security checks

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Existing licenses continue to work normally
- ✅ No database migration required
- ✅ Online validation behavior unchanged
- ✅ License server interaction remains the same

## Troubleshooting

### License Not Working Offline

1. **Check Grace Period**: Verify license was validated within 30 days
2. **Check Expiry**: Ensure license hasn't expired
3. **Clear Cache**: Try `LicenseService.refreshLicense()` when online
4. **Debug Logs**: Enable debug mode to see offline validation details

### Offline Status Not Showing

1. **Check Configuration**: Verify `ALLOW_OFFLINE_MODE: true`
2. **Network Status**: Confirm network is actually disconnected
3. **Cache Timing**: Wait for cache to expire (5 minutes)
4. **Component Update**: Ensure notification component is included

## Summary

This fix enables seamless offline operation for the POS system while maintaining security and license compliance. The software now gracefully handles network interruptions and provides clear user feedback about offline status, ensuring business continuity in all network conditions.

**Key Improvement**: Licensed software remains functional for up to 30 days without internet connectivity, solving the original issue where offline operation was impossible.
